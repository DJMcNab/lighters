## Lighters (Name pending)

An experiment into code generation of shaders for Rust programs (as a stable alternative to [rust-gpu](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/rust-gpu)).

## License

There is currently no license available for lighters, as there are potential IP concerns related to its planned use for a university project.
